#How to get a data set
#Start with Sequence read archive
#step 1, LOOK FOR ORGANISM!!!
#Step 2, filter results for paird, and illumina
#Step 3, choose organism data set
#Step 4, look at an individual dataset evaluate coverage based on presumed genome size (use ncbi genome setting)
#Step 4, verify genomic dna. forward and reverse. look at read length.
#Step 5, save search parameters
#Step 6, go to assembly!!!!!
#Step 7, Now you have a dataset


#How to download Data
#Step 1, Go to the SRR page, This is your dataset
#step 2, go to Data access, Not reads!
#Step 3, Click Sra-Download AND DOWNLOAD!!!! YAY!!!!!! YAYYYYYYY
#step 4, verify fastq

#How to make a Branch (No trees necessary)
#Info. THERE EXIST BRANCH MASTER!!!!!!!!!!
#Info. We can make a branch with something different.
#info. Remote repository is often 1 commit ahead/behind the remote/master
#info. Make maseter 2 to create a more current or a branch that separates the new ideas
#info. Making a second master, is important to make differences that are in a different BRANCH
#info. We should have our own branch, Called ourbranch
#Step 1, Have the repository
git clone https:// yadda_yadda_yadda
#step 2, look at branches
git branch
#step 3, make branch (refer to cheat sheet in day_2)
git branch sweet_changes
#step 4, check where you are, stay put, should still be on master
git status
#step 5, got to your new branch
git checkout sweet_changes
#Step 6, make changes in the new branch repository locally
touch sweet_new_file
#step 7, look around
git status
#step 8, make a new directory in the repository for the new branches
mkdir sweet_changes
#step 9, let the remote repository know you have made sweet_changes
git add *
#step 10, commit changes
git commit -m "made a sweet_new_file"
#step 11, push it up
git push origin sweet_changes
#info. You can easily switch between branches
git checkout master
#info. How To Merge branches
#step 1, merge branches
git merge sweet_changes
git status
#step 2, push to MASTER
Git push origin master
#switch back to the master
git checkout master
git status
#verify with gui
